# Rotten Tomatoes
This is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using the Rotten Tomatoes API.

I don't use Autolayout yet so the UI is only for iPhone 4s (3.5-inch).

The project was built with version 7.1.1 (7B1005) - Language: Swift

Libraries: AFNetworking, JTProgressHUD

Time spent: About 12 hours
